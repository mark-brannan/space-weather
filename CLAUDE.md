# signalk-noaa-space-weather

A Signal K server plugin that publishes NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center
data to a boat's Signal K instance.

## Architecture

```
src/
  index.ts        plugin definition, start/stop, the PRODUCTS registry
  config.ts       JSON schema, typed Settings, normalisation of raw props
  publisher.ts    the ONLY module that touches the Signal K `app` object
  noaa/client.ts  the ONLY outbound network I/O
  paths.ts        every Signal K path this plugin owns, plus the scale tables
  parse.ts        pure parsing and transformation; no I/O, no `app`
  products/       one module per NOAA product
```

**To add a data source: write `src/products/<name>.ts` implementing `Product`,
add it to `PRODUCTS` in `index.ts`.** Nothing else. That is the whole reason
for this shape.

A `Product` declares `schedule` (`observations` or `notifications`), optional
`enabled(settings)` if the user can switch it off, optional `metadata(settings)`
published once per start, and `refresh(ctx)`.

Keep parsing in `parse.ts` and pure. It is what makes the fixtures useful.

## Non-obvious constraints

**Tests must run with no network.** The
[Signal K plugin registry](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-plugin-registry)
scores this package by cloning the default branch and running `npm ci`,
`npm run build`, then `npm test` under `firejail --net=none` with a **60 second
cap**. `test/offline.test.ts` asserts the no-network property so a stray request
fails locally instead of only in the registry. Always test against a captured
payload in `examples/`, never the live service.

**NOAA changes payload shapes without notice.** This has happened at least
twice and both times it silently broke published data:

- the solar wind summaries went from `{"Bt": 5, "Bz": -3}` to
  `[{"bt": 4, "bz_gsm": -1}]`, which made the plugin publish `NaN` for months
- the planetary K-index forecast alternates between a header-row table and a
  list of records

So: **capture a dated fixture into `examples/` before writing a parser**, and
make the parser accept the old shape as well as the new one. `parseSolarWind`
and `kpRows` in `parse.ts` are the pattern to copy.

**Zone metadata generates notifications.** The server (`signalk-server`
`src/zones.ts`) watches any path with `meta.zones` and raises
`notifications.<path>` on zone *transitions*. Its matcher is half-open —
`value >= lower && value < upper` — and `Infinity` is not representable in
JSON, so a top zone must **omit** `upper` rather than set it to `Infinity`,
or the highest value matches nothing at all.

`alertMethod` / `warnMethod` / `alarmMethod` on the metadata control the
notification's `method` array independently of its `state`. That is how a
level can be visible in the UI without interrupting the user, and it is
load-bearing for the design below.

**Alarm thresholds are deliberately conservative.** NOAA's frequency tables put
a level 1 event on roughly a quarter of all days and a level 5 on about four
days per 11-year solar cycle. Alerting on anything below level 3 is noise on a
boat. Default mapping: 0 `nominal`, 1–2 `normal`, 3 `alert` with an **empty
method array**, 4 `warn` (visual), 5 `alarm` (visual + sound). `zoneAlertThreshold`
moves the pivot. Do not make this louder without a frequency argument.

**Signal K wants SI units.** Solar wind speed in m/s (NOAA gives km/s), Bt and
Bz in Tesla (NOAA gives nT), probabilities as 0–1 ratios with `units: "ratio"`
(NOAA gives whole percents). Dimensionless indices such as the G/S/R levels and
Kp carry **no** `units` key — the admin UI renders the string verbatim, so
`units: "none"` displays as "2 none".

**Never publish `NaN`.** Return `null` from a parser instead. Several fixtures
exist specifically to pin this.

**`main` must stay in package.json.** The server loads plugins with
`require()` on an absolute directory path, and Node's CommonJS resolver ignores
`exports` in that case. Removing `main` reintroduces issue #1.

## Conventions

No semicolons, two-space indent, single quotes — run `npm run format`
(prettier, configured in `.prettierrc`); `npm run format:check` verifies. Comments
explain *why*, not what. Tests assert behaviour — values, states, paths, unit
conversions, boundaries — never display strings.

## Local development

```shell
npm install && npm run build && npm test
```

There is a Signal K server already running in Docker on this machine at
`localhost:3001`, installed from the published npm package — useful for
read-only checks against real, released behavior (it's what backs any
"browse the live server" research), but it runs whatever version is
currently published, not this checkout's uncommitted changes. Don't
restart, reconfigure, or write through it without checking who else might
be using it first.

To run this checkout's own uncommitted changes against a live server:
clone the actual [SignalK/signalk-server
repo](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server) to `~/signalk-server`
(`npm install && npm link`, once), and use `~/.signalk-dev` as the shared
scratch config directory (`SIGNALK_NODE_CONFIG_DIR`) plugins get linked
into — never a real boat's `~/.signalk`. `npm link` each plugin checkout
once from its own directory, then `npm link <package-name>` from inside
`~/.signalk-dev` to wire it in. Run with:

```shell
cd ~/signalk-server && SIGNALK_NODE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.signalk-dev PORT=3100 bin/signalk-server
```

The plugin loads from `dist/`, so rebuild (`npm run build` or `npm run
watch`) and restart the server to pick up a change. This is a single shared
instance — port 3000 is Grafana, 3001 and 3005 are other Docker containers,
all already in use on this machine — so check nothing else is running
against `~/.signalk-dev`/port 3100 before starting it, the same way you'd
check before touching a shared branch.

If the admin UI 500s on `/admin/`, npm has hoisted `@signalk/server-admin-ui`
somewhere the server doesn't look; symlink it into
`node_modules/signalk-server/node_modules/@signalk/`.

## Releasing

Publishing happens from CI via npm OIDC trusted publishing — tag `vX.Y.Z` and
push. No npm token should ever live on a developer machine.

Version bumps are automatic in two layers, so a real release never depends on
remembering: `.husky/pre-commit` auto-patch-bumps `package.json` at commit
time if nothing on the branch has already given it an explicit bump (compared
against the latest git tag, not the immediate parent commit). `.github/workflows/auto-version.yml`
then tags and publishes whatever version lands on `main`, whether that came
from the hook or from an explicit `npm version minor`/`major` before
committing. Bump explicitly yourself for anything more than the smallest
change; let the hook cover the rest.
